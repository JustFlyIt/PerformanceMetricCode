# Stream Metric Benchmark

This "stream" metric code measures memory transfer rates in MB/s for simple computational kernels coded in C.

This code can be compiled/linked for three different platforms: INTEL, ARM, RISCV.

To build the various platform versions, make the following:

make intel

make arm

make riscv

Note: before making, do a "make clean"
