# PerformanceMetrics

Contains various hardware benchmark metric code for measuring the performance of
multi-platform hardware.

The purpose for this repository is to:

    Provide metric tools for establishing performance benchmarks between hardware components.
    Demonstrate how to cross compile for multiple platforms including: x86-64, ARM and RISCV. A Raspberry Pi platform option is coming

One of iSpace's key tenents is not to require specific development tools but to give software engineers the opportunity to choose for themselves inorder to maximize productivity and development satisfaction. Use of commandline tools is not required. Eclipse or some other develpoment environment can be substituted and populated with the makefile info included in this directory.

Currently, ARM development is being done via the command line, supported by the text editor Atom. Atom is extremely useful as a text editor and code manager with a clean and concise Git interface. But as with Eclipse, Atom is not required.
