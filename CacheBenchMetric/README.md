# Cache Bench Metric Benchmark

Cache Bench is a synthetic benchmark that measures the performance
of the central processing units (CPU) cache and memory operations. The code is
written in C. 

This code can be compiled/linked for three different platforms: INTEL, ARM, RISCV.

To build the various platform versions, make the following:

make intel

make arm

make riscv

Note: before making, do a "make clean"
